# Movie_Correlation_Project
This project focuses on finding the highest correlation of other attributes to gross revenue in the movie industry.

Correlation: Correlation means association â€“ more precisely, it measures the extent to which two variables are related. It shows whether there is a relationship between variables and the direction and strength of that relationship.

## Libraries
The project includes some of the basic Python functions to process, clean, analyze, and visualize data.

The Python libraries used are pandas, seaborn, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Information about the Dataset
This data set is taken from Kaggle. It contains 7669 movies and each movie has 15 attributes that are- budget, company, country, director, gross, name, rating, released date, runtime, score, votes, star, writer, and year.

## Conclusion 
The project involved cleaning and analyzing a movie dataset. The main conclusion is that 'budget' and 'votes' have the highest correlations to gross earnings. Both have a positive correlation: as a movie's budget and audience ratings increase, gross earnings tend to increase as well. These insights can be valuable for decision-making in the movie industry, as they highlight factors that significantly influence box office success.
