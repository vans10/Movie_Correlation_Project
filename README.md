## Conclusion 
The project involved cleaning and analyzing a movie dataset. The main conclusion is that 'budget' and 'votes' have the highest correlations to gross earnings.

These insights can be valuable for decision-making in the movie industry, as they highlight factors that significantly influence box office success.
